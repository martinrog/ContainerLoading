# ContainerLoading
Container loading project

This project contains a program that simplifies the process of shipping goods. This is done by
displaying a visualization of the loading proces. This is very important because, the costs of
overseas shipping are often very high, so the container must be loaded optimally. Also a price
is automatically given per product that will cover the cost of the shipping.

To get the desired output, only the “main” file has to be runned and then fill in the quantities.
The output of the program provides all the information needed. To see the visualization, paste 
the URL next to “image_complete” into the search bar of your browser. To see an intermediate 
step, paste the URL next to "image_sbs" into the search bar of your browser.
